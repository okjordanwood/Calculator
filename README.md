# Calculator Application
A simple console-based calculator application built in C++ that supports various mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and square root calculations. This project demonstrates basic C++ programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Features
- Addition (+): Calculates the sum of two numbers.
- Subtraction (-): Computes the difference between two numbers.
- Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
- Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (with zero division check).
- Modulus (%): Finds the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
- Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second.
- Square Root (âˆš): Computes the square root of a number.
- Exit: Terminates the program.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- C++ Standard: C++11 or higher is recommended.

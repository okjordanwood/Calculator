# Calculator Application
A simple console-based calculator application built in C++ that supports various mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and square root calculations. This project demonstrates basic C++ programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Features
- Addition (+): Calculates the sum of two numbers.
- Subtraction (-): Computes the difference between two numbers.
- Multiplication (*): Multiplies two numbers.
- Division (/): Divides the first number by the second (with zero division check).
- Modulus (%): Finds the remainder when the first number is divided by the second.
- Exponentiation (^): Raises the first number to the power of the second.
- Square Root (âˆš): Computes the square root of a number.
- Exit: Terminates the program.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler: Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- C++ Standard: C++11 or higher is recommended.

## Usage
1. Run the Application:
  - Start the application by executing the compiled binary as shown above.

2 Select an Operation:
  - You will be presented with a menu of operations. Enter the number corresponding to your desired operation.

3. Input Numbers:
  - Depending on the operation selected, enter the required numbers. For operations other than square root, provide two numbers. For square root, provide only one number.

4. View Result:
  - The application will display the result of the selected operation.

5. Exit the Application:
  - To exit, select the 8 option from the menu.
